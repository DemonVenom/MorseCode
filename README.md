# MorseCode

‚¶Å	Morse Code translator: write a MorseTranslator class converts English text to Morse code.

When translating from words into code, place a space between encoded letters and 3 spaces between encoded words to simulate the keying pauses.
Have the user enter the text as a single line terminated by a newline (see: BufferedReader and InputStreamReader to read a single line of input in one fell swoop).
Then add the ability to convert from Morse code (in the above format) to English.
